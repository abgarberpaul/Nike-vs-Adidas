## primary questions:
  - Which company is more agressive in discounting (nike or adidas)?
  
  - Would we recommend change to either discounting strategy (ie: if Adidas is discounting 40% and Nike only 30%, who has higher customer ratings (gender, category)?
  
  - How does discounting vary across demographic attributes (gender, category) and avgerage sale price?

## Data Clean up
  This project included more extensive clean up that previous projects, as we reconciled two systems with varying feature categories that was extracted without the benefit of an official API or internally organized data collection system. Clean up steps included creating new unique categories for describing product attributes including targeted gender (man/women/unisex/child), and other factors
